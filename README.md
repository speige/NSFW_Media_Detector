# NSFW_Media_Detector

## Work-in-progress. Long-term goal is to analyze a video file for NSFW content (suggestive/Risqu√© images and vulgar language in audio) and spit out timestamps to allow the video to be re-rendered as a censored version. Back-end is coded in a modular architecture with generic APIs to allow the core algorithms to be consumed by other apps.
